# Project Proposal 
For my research project, I want to compare the Amazon books best sellers to the Goodreads bestsellers, to determine if there are differences related to the genre, price or some other factor that make books more or less popular on each site. As an avid reader, I’m always curios about I should read next. Furthermore, I’m always interested in what is popular or trending and think it would be interesting to see if there are differences in most popular books on one site versus another and what these factors could be. 

For now, the data sources I would be exploring two data sets:
 -the first one is a comprehensive list of all the books reviewed on good reads with their ratings and number of reviews(https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)
 -the second data looks at the ratings of the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon (https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019 )
 -to go more in depth, I might also have to look at the Goodreads API to collect data on the genres, etc. 

Through a comparative analysis, I want to see whether price or genre or publisher or edition at all effects the different ratings and whether these stats are different or the same on these two reviewing sites. I image this data will be organized in columns comparing the popularity of books on each site, divided by genre, price, gender of the writer, etc. 

Finally, I expect to find out whether reviews and rating change based on the fact that they were posted on social media platform or a retail platform. I hypothesize for now that the reviews on a social media platform would be more forgiving than the reviews/ratings on a retail platform since the money spent would be less of a factor.
