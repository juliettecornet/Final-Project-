    "## Part 1: Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a comparative literature major, close-reader textual analysis is some thing I'm particularly interested in. Therefore, when we begun doing textual analysis via data science, I knew this was what I wanted to do my final project on. Considering Taylor Swift has recently been making a comeback, I thought it would intersting to look into her music and her persona which is where I got the inspiration for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Taylor swift is known for constantly re-inventing herself. Her ever-changing persona is known to be split up into different \"eras.\" While this is very apparent in the changes of her physial appearance and in her music videos and concert performances, I am curious to see if these shifts are identifiable from the lyrics in all her albums alone.Through data and textual analysis, I want to see if certain trends in her lyrics give us insight into the different changes she has undergone over the years. Therefore, through a combination of data science and textual analysis, is it possible to indenity different trends in Taylor Swift's lyrics throughout her albums?\n",

    "The dataset I will be using is from Github and has every lyric from every song form her first eight albums: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/taylor_swift_lyrics.csv ."
