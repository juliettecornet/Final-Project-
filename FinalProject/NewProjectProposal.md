# New Final Project Proposal
## Comnpare the differnt eras/albums of Taylor Swift

For my final project, I have decided that I wanted to do textual analysis of all of Taylor Swift's songs and albums to try and track her different "eras". For those unfamiliar, Taylor is known her her constantly changing persona over the years since she has been constantly reinventing herself. While this is very apparent in the changes of her physial appearance and in her music videos and concert performance, I want to see if these shifts are apparent from the lyrics in all her albums alone. Through data and textual analysis, I want to see if certain trends in her lyrics give us insifht into the different changes she has undergone over the years. 

The dataset I will be using is from Github and has every lyric from every song of every one of her albums: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/taylor_swift_lyrics.csv . However, I might find that it could be easier to just go into her song and import them myself. But for now I will be working with this Github dataset.

To find differences in her lyrics, I want to look at word count to see if length plays any part in her different eras. From there, I want to look at the word frequencies to find out if the most common words in each album give us a sense of her persona. I will then compare those words to what I know about her persona. I also think I would be interesting to do sentiment checks and polarity checks to find the overall tone in each of her albums. 

For now, I hypthesize that there will be some kiind of tonal differences between her albums, although some might be more obvious than others.
